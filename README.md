### Neighborhood Map Project #5 For Udacity FEND

This is an interactive map of Coffee places in Newport, Oregon.

#### Installation

Either clone the repository using GIT, or use the download ZIP link on the right hand side of the screen. Open the /dist directory and double click the index.html file. You need to have a working internet connection for the app to work because it draws information from Google Maps and Foursquare.
